# NODE js practice

As a JAVA developer I would like to broaden my horizon with some up-to-date technologies. 
So I've decided to understand V8 engine and how NODE works under the hood. 
The last part of the learning process to create a basic example 
with the following <b>technologies</b>:
  - NODE js
  - Express
  - Inversify as IoC
  - Jest as test framework
  - MongoDB
  - Docker
  - AWS - beanstalk

## Purposes
- Learn totally <b>new</b> technologies
- Build a basic REST API with nodeJs and Express
- Persist to DB (NoSQL)
- Handle at least 2 domain
- Proper error handling
- Configure eslint
- Introduce Test framework
- Build as docker image

## Extras
- Introduce IoC
- Host on AWS EC2
